To use Stage File Proxy, you must add variables to $conf in settings.php:

REQUIRED:
$conf['stage_file_proxy_origin] = 'http://example.com'; // no trailing slash

OPTIONAL:

$conf['stage_file_proxy_use_imagecache_root'] = TRUE;

Default is TRUE.

If this is true (default) then Stage File Proxy will look for /imagecache/ in
the URL and determine the original file and request that rather than the
processed file, then send a header to the browser to refresh the image and let
imagecache handle it. This will speed up future imagecache requests for the
same original file.

$conf['stage_file_proxy_hotlink'] = FALSE;

Default is FALSE.

If this is true then Stage File Proxy will not transfer the remote file to the
local machine, it will just serve a 301 to the remote file and let the origin
webserver handle it.
